# Thanks and acknowledgments
sealog-client-alvin-topside is based on the the [sealog-client](https://github.com/webbpinner/sealog-client) project.

Sealog is in ongoing development thanks to the generosity of the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) who have supported the project since 2018. Thanks also to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who provided the initial inspiration for the project and funded the development of the Alvin-specific version.

Lastly I want to thank the UNOLS community who have helped me since the beginning by sharing their wealth of experience and technical knowledge.
